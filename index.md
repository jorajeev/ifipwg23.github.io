# Overview

IFIP Working Group 2.3 on Programming Methodology is a [working group](https://ifip.hal.science/IFIP-WG) of the [International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP)](http://ifip.org).  Our main goal is to increase programmers’ ability to compose programs. We provide an international forum for discussion and cross-fertilization of ideas between researchers in programming methodology and related fields. Typically, members report on work in progress and expect suggestions and advice. Discussions are often broadened by inviting "observers" to meetings as full participants, some of whom eventually become members.

# Scope

Our scope of work was introduced by Edsger W. Dijkstra in Meeting 0 (Oslo, Norway, July 1969):
* Identification of sources of difficulties encountered in present-day programming;
* The interdependence between the formulation of problems and the formulation of programs, and the mapping of relations existing in the world of problems into the relations among programs and their components;
* Intellectual disciplines and problem-solving techniques that can aid programmers in the composition of programs;
* The problem of achieving program reliability;
* The consequences of requirements for program adaptability;
* The problem of provability of program correctness and its influence on the structure of programs and on the process of their composition;
* Guidelines of partitioning large programming tasks and defining the interfaces between the parts;
* Software for mechanized assistance to program composition.
