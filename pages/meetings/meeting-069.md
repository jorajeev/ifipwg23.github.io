<h2>Host: Sophia Drossopoulou</h2>

<h2>Local Information</h2>

## Venue

**[Katakouzenos House Museum](https://katakouzenos.gr/en/katakouzenos-house/a-house-museum/)**, right in the center, opposite Syntagma (the parliament).

### Book Your Trip

If you're coming by air, you would land at **Athens International Airport**, which is a highly awarded airport.

- **Taxis** to the center cost about **€50**.
- There is a **direct train** line to the center every 30 minutes for **€10**.
- **Buses** are also available.

> If it were up to me, I would choose **Aegean Airlines** — also a highly awarded airline.

### Hotels

I could not make a reasonable group booking. Instead, I am making a list of recommendations here:

### Attendance Costs

These will depend on the number of attendees. Costs will fluctuate between **€250 and €320 for the week**, covering:

- Room hire
- Coffees
- Lunch

> The more we are, the cheaper it gets.

These costs **will not cover dinner and breakfast**.

- I will **not organize breakfast**; you are on your own
- I will **organize dinners** separately from **Sunday to Friday**, each in a different restaurant.
